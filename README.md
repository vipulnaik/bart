This repository will contain historical data on the Bay Area Rapid Transit, including ridership, fares, and route frequency.

No guarantees on when data will actually be up -- it is low priority and I'll basically do this when I have some time in between other things.

Sources I am using for data:

* [Ridership](http://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership)
* Historical fare and route data: Links to fill in
