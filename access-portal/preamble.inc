<p>This website related to the <a href="https://www.bart.gov">Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)</a>, a mass rapid transit system serving the San Francisco Bay Area, is under construction. When completed, it will contain some historical information on BART ridership (taken from the <a href="https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership">BART ridership reports page</a>), station data, and fares and schedules (taken from the <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/F%26S%20WS%203_%202017%20ENGL.pdf">current version</a> and <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/F_S%20FEB%202016%20.pdf">historical</a> <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/Fare_Scheds%20Jan%202014.pdf">versions</a> <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/BART_FS_31.pdf">of</a> <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/BART_FS_091409.pdf">the</a> <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/BART010108.pdf">fares</a> <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/BART091205.pdf">and</a> schedules booklet). You can see the underlying code for this website and the SQL insertion commands for the database it uses at the <a href="https://github.com/vipulnaik/bart">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Due to rounding, entry and exit counts where either station is "all stations" may not match the source data precisely. It'll be off by at most the number of stations, and usually by a lot less.</p>
