https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership says "The files are automatically updated and are usually available by the 5th of the next month." It links to http://64.111.127.166/ridership/ for ridership data for 2020. However, I don't see data for July 2020 at the latter page, though by the time I send this message, the "5th of the next month" is coming to a close. For all previous months, data was uploaded on the 3rd of the next month.

Can you upload the July 2020 data?

Thank you!!!
